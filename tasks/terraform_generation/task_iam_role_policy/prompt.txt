You are generating Terraform code. Create EXACTLY three files: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf.

Requirements:
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Provider: hashicorp/aws
- Must work with LocalStack at http://localhost:4566
  Configure provider endpoints for iam, sts to http://localhost:4566 and set:
  skip_credentials_validation=true
  skip_metadata_api_check=true
  skip_requesting_account_id=true
  s3_use_path_style=true
- Variables (ALL must have default values to avoid interactive prompts):
  region (string, default = "us-east-1")
  role_name (string)
  policy_name (string)
- Create:
  1 IAM Role with name = var.role_name
    Trust policy must allow EC2 service to assume the role (principal: ec2.amazonaws.com)
  1 IAM Policy with name = var.policy_name
    Policy document should allow: s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket on all resources
  1 IAM Role Policy Attachment to attach the policy to the role
- Tag all resources:
  project = "sre-skills-bench"
  task_id = "task_iam_role_policy"
- Outputs:
  role_id
  role_arn
  policy_arn

Return ONLY code blocks, one per file, labeled with the filename.
