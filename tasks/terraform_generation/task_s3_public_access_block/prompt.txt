You are generating Terraform code. Create EXACTLY three files: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf.

Requirements:
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Provider: hashicorp/aws
- Must work with LocalStack at http://localhost:4566
  Configure provider endpoints for s3, iam, sts to http://localhost:4566 and set:
  skip_credentials_validation=true
  skip_metadata_api_check=true
  skip_requesting_account_id=true
  s3_use_path_style=true
- Variables (ALL must have default values to avoid interactive prompts):
  region (string, default = "us-east-1")
  bucket_name (string)
  block_public_acls (bool)
  block_public_policy (bool)
  ignore_public_acls (bool)
  restrict_public_buckets (bool)
- Create:
  1 S3 bucket with name = var.bucket_name
  1 S3 Public Access Block resource attached to the bucket
    Configure all four settings from variables:
    - block_public_acls = var.block_public_acls
    - block_public_policy = var.block_public_policy
    - ignore_public_acls = var.ignore_public_acls
    - restrict_public_buckets = var.restrict_public_buckets
- Tag all resources:
  project = "sre-skills-bench"
  task_id = "task_s3_public_access_block"
- Outputs:
  bucket_id
  bucket_arn

Return ONLY code blocks, one per file, labeled with the filename.
